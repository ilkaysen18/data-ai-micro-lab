<main>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    These survey and interview questions are designed to explore how students and young professionals in Türkiye perceive the rapidly changing job market under the influence of artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and digital transformation. The aim is to identify themes of <strong>hope, fear, adaptability, and human resilience</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Section 1: Demographic Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Age group</li>
    <li>University and department</li>
    <li>Year of study (1st–4th undergraduate, master’s, PhD, recent graduate)</li>
    <li>Main language(s) of study (Turkish, English, both)</li>
    <li>Current work or internship experience (if any)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 2: Perceptions of AI and Automation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How familiar do you feel with AI and automation concepts?</li>
    <li>Have you used AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney, Copilot) in your studies or work?</li>
    <li>On a scale of 1–10, how optimistic are you about AI improving your future job prospects?</li>
    <li>What concerns do you have about AI’s impact on future employment opportunities?</li>
    <li>Which fields or roles do you think are most likely to be replaced or enhanced by AI?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 3: Education and Preparedness</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you think your university education is preparing you for a job market affected by AI?</li>
    <li>What skills do you feel are <strong>most essential</strong> to stay employable in the next decade?</li>
    <li>Have you received any training related to AI, data literacy, or digital tools?</li>
    <li>What kind of upskilling programs would you find most valuable?</li>
    <li>How does English proficiency influence your access to AI-related learning or job opportunities?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 4: Human and Emotional Dimensions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you ever feel anxious or uncertain about finding meaningful work in the future?</li>
    <li>What gives you hope or motivation despite these uncertainties?</li>
    <li>Which human traits — such as empathy, creativity, ethics — do you believe will remain valuable even when many tasks are automated?</li>
    <li>In your opinion, what does “staying human” mean in an AI-driven world?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 5: Social Equity and Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you think AI will widen or reduce existing inequalities in Türkiye’s job market?</li>
    <li>What specific barriers (economic, linguistic, geographic) could prevent some students from benefiting from AI opportunities?</li>
    <li>What policies or institutional supports could make this transition more equitable?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 6: Proposed Solutions & Visions for the Future</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How could universities and the government support students’ transition into the AI economy?</li>
    <li>What kind of jobs do you think will emerge that do not exist today?</li>
    <li>Would you consider entrepreneurship, cross-sector work, or remote global jobs as alternatives?</li>
    <li>If you could design an ideal course or program for the future job market, what would it include?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Interview Guide (For Qualitative Sessions)</h2>
  <p>
    These prompts can be used for semi-structured interviews or focus groups after survey data
    collection to explore emotional and narrative insights in detail.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Describe in your own words how you imagine your career path might look in 10 years.</li>
    <li>How has news about AI or automation changed the way you think about your major or career?</li>
    <li>What moments (in daily study, internships, or conversations) make you feel either inspired or worried about AI?</li>
    <li>Do you believe Turkish society is emotionally ready for a future where some jobs disappear?</li>
    <li>What does resilience mean to you personally — in terms of financial security, emotional wellbeing, or social contribution?</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    “Our goal is not only to collect data but to listen — to understand how students in Türkiye reinterpret hope,
    work, and purpose under the weight of transformation.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Participation should be informed, voluntary, and anonymous unless explicitly consented otherwise.</li>
    <li>Data will be used solely for educational and research purposes under appropriate data protection measures.</li>
    <li>Interviews should be recorded or quoted only with written consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Optional Extensions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Quantitative additions: sentiment analysis of responses, keyword frequency, cluster mapping of optimism levels.</li>
    <li>Qualitative additions: thematic storytelling, bilingual student diaries, public exhibits or discussion panels.</li>
  </ul>
